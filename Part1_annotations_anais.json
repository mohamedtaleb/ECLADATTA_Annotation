The first row describes the year 1948, when the company became the first British lighting company to mass-produce fluorescent tubes, with one of the first installations being in the Westminster City Library in London. The next row, for the year 1952, explains that the Chief Chemist Dr Peter Ranby developed a new range of phosphors, leading to the introduction of the White \u201c3500K\u201d lamp with a colour appearance midway between daylight and warm white. In 1954, the company introduced its flagship product, the Atlas Popular Pack, which was the first mass-produced fitting to be sold complete with its tube as a single package. The following year, 1955, saw the launch of the Alpha One lantern, the first hermetically sealed and injection moulded optical system for road lighting, designed by Richard Stevens. The year 1957 is notable for the introduction of the Atlas Aurama system, an advanced Son et Lumiere show controlled by electronic dimming, which was used for entertainment at Woburn Abbey. In 1962, the company introduced the VASI, a visual approach slope indicator developed in conjunction with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, to aid aircraft landing. The next year, 1963, saw the development of the electroluminescent Image Retaining Panel for X-ray screens and radar scanning. The year 1964 marked the introduction of Q-File, an electronic lighting control system designed in conjunction with the BBC, to improve theatre and TV lighting. In 1965, the company mass-produced Flashcubes for photography, developed in association with Sylvania and Kodak. The year 1967 is significant for the launch of the first twin-filament tungsten halogen car headlamp, allowing drivers to use either full beam or dipped lights, and the company also manufactured high pressure sodium lamps and supplied lighting for Britain's new motorways. In 1970, the company developed Magicube X with Kodak, a photographic flash cube not requiring a battery, and the CSI lamp for floodlighting, outside filming, and studio work. The year 1972 saw the company become the first lighting company to win the Queen's Award to Industry for Technical Innovation, for developing halogen lamps, and it also introduced the \u2018Arena\u2019 system, a new concept in commercial architecture that integrated lighting, heating, and ventilation. The company introduced the 70 W high pressure sodium lamp in 1976. In 1981, it launched two major improvements in fluorescent lighting, an energy saving replacement for the ordinary light bulb and the high frequency electronic ballast. The year 1984 marked the development of the Haloheat cooker hob with halogen heat lamps. In 1987, the company manufactured a range of low wattage single ended metal halide and dichroic tungsten halogen lamps and fittings. The C-VAS lighting management system for offices was developed in 1988. The Aria spotlight and Modulight fluorescent won Die gute Industrieform design awards at the Hannover Fair, Germany, in 1989. The company launched Sensa, the first independent, intelligent lighting management fitting for offices, in 1991. The Sensa 2 intelligent luminaire was voted a Millennium product by the Design Council in 2000.
